# Foodmixr
Imagine you're working at a restaurant, and you realize that many of the patrons ask about what song is being played. You keep hearing that they try using apps that captures audio, process it, and return the song information, but they haven't been working well because there is too much noise in the restaurant. What could be done about this issue?

*ENTER FOODMIXR*

Foodmixr is an application that allows customers and others to see what song is being played at a given establishment without the need for audio capture. All the establishment has to do is sign up with Foodmixr Web, and then clients with the [Foodmixr Mobile](https://github.com/kenjcastilla/foodmixr-mobile) application can see what is being played in real time. The struggle to find out what beauty is being played
behind all of that commotion ends here.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
